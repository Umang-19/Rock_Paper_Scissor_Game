# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game

We all have played this game "Rock-Paper-Scissor" in childhood with our friends. Now let's play it with computer. 
This is a very easy game for programming beginners. The game is made by using simple logic of if else ladder and while loop. 

Here, first we generate a random number between 1 to 100 and based on it we assign a letter to the computer :
'r' for rock 
'p' for paper
's' for scissor

Then we ask the user to choose 1 letter :
'r' for rock 
'p' for paper
's' for scissor

Rules of the Game (You must know them, right): 

if one input is Rock and other is Paper :- Paper win
if one input is Rock and other is Scissor :- Rock win
if one input is Paper and other is Scissor :- Scissor win


Output :

(If you win) 

CONGRATULATIONS !! YOU WON 
Press y to play again and n to exit 


(If you lose )

Press y to play again and n to exit 

end

Happy coding!! :)
